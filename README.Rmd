# excess

<!-- badges: start -->

The `excess` package is designed to provide a set of tools and workflows to analyze and interpret hydrological cross-sectional data. This package is currently in development, so use with caution :smile:.

## Installation

You can install the development version of excess from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("brownhr/excess")
```

## Calculating cross-sectional area

Under the hood, the `xs_area()` function calculates the area of a cross-section through use of the **trapezoidal rule**, as provided by the `pracma` package.


```{r testdata}
library(excess)

head(testdata)

```


```{r data, eval = F}
## If you can't find the `testdata` object, load it with data()

data(testdata)
```



```{r xs-area}

xs_area(testdata)

```

You can visualize cross-sections with `xs_ribbon()`


```{r xs-ribbon}

xs_ribbon(testdata)

```
